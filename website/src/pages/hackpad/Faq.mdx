# Frequently Asked Questions

**What gets shipped to me?**
- a soldering iron!
- a 3D printed case
- An unsoldered Seeed XIAO RP2040 with headers
- Any of the components requested from the [approved parts list](/parts)
- a $20 HCB grant. This will be used to cover **both** your **PCB** as well as any additional parts you may want! I/O expanders, random sensors, etc. It MUST be used for your hackpad. You will need to upload receipts

**When is the deadline?** \
February 16th, 2025. This is the deadline for the macropad. The deadline for the keyboard is March 16th, 2025.

**Where can I find KiCAD footprints / what's the measurement for this thing / etc** \
A lot of these questions can be answered by checking out the [resources and tips section](/resources)! You can find **KiCAD footprints**, 3D models, etc

**Can I use a microcontroller other than the XIAO RP2040?** \
You can, however the following conditions apply:
- You need to fit all the parts for the MCU of choice + PCB in your $20 grant
- Your schematic + PCB is not going to be checked over - design at your own risk

The XIAO is a great primer and I recommend using it, but it's totally understandable if you want to do something more advanced! We won't stop you :)

**What's new with v2?** \
Lots of stuff! Updated list of requirements, more content, and other goodies - the big thing is that after making a macropad, you can design and submit an entire ***keyboard*** to be made!

**Do *I* have to make a macropad before making a keyboard?** \
Absolutely! A keyboard is *significantly* harder to design, and so its a prerequisite you understand the fundamentals with a macropad first. You don't need to wait for it to come though! You can start your keyboard as soon as its approved

**Will my hackpad come assembled?** \
Unfortunately not! Not to fear though - we'll send you a soldering iron, straight from HQ if you don't have one already.

**Can I use acrylic/cnc metal/etc for the case/plate?** \
NO!!! Only 3D prints are supported for the macropad. Keyboards are allowed to use acrylic, but CNC metal is still banned.

**Where are the parts shipped from?** \
Vermont, USA!

**Can I use parts outside of the approved list?** \
Yup! Put it in your $20 grant

**What colours are the keycaps?** \
We have red, black, and white keycaps at HQ. You can request what color specifically, but it's not guaranteed it'll be fulfilled. Sorry!

**Can I use Choc switches?** \
You can! We'll have V2's at HQ. note: please use 19.05x19.05mm spacing, or else the keycaps won't fit

**I have more questions!!!**  \
Join the #hackpad channel in the Hack Club slack!

**What are the footprint name for diodes/resistors?**

Diodes are D_DO-35_SOD27_P7.62mm_Horizontal.

Resistors are R_Axial_DIN0204_L3.6mm_D1.6mm_P7.62mm_Horizontal
